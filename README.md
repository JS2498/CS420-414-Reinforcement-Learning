# Reinforcement Learning 
Contains solution to assignment problems of the course "CS404 : Reinforcement Learning" offered by Dr. Prabuchandran K J at IIT Dharwad.

* Assignment 2 Bandit Algorithms
  * Implemented $`\epsilon`$-greedy, variable $\epsilon$-greedy, Softmax, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson sampling algorithms for Bernoulli and Normal reward setting
* Assignment 3 Value Based Methods
  * A classical maze problem was considered and used policy iteration and value iteration to solve the problem.
