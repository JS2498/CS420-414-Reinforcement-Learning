# Reinforcement Learning 
Contains solutions to assignment problems of the course "CS404 : Reinforcement Learning" offered by Dr. Prabuchandran K J at IIT Dharwad.

* [Assignment 2](https://github.com/JS2498/RL_Lab/tree/main/Assignment_2) : Bandit Algorithms
  * Implemented epsilon-greedy, variable epsilon-greedy, Softmax, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson sampling algorithms for Bernoulli and Normal reward setting

* [Assignment 3](https://github.com/JS2498/RL_Lab/tree/main/Assignment3) : Value Based Methods
  * A classical maze problem was considered and policy iteration and value iteration were used to solve the problem.

* [Assignment 4](https://github.com/JS2498/RL_Lab/tree/main/Assignment_4) : Sample Based Monte-Carlo and Temporal Difference Methods
  * Implemented Every Visit Monte-Carlo, Q-learning and SARSA agents for classical maze and Mountain Car environment.

* [Assignment 5](https://github.com/JS2498/RL_Lab/tree/main/Assignment_5) : Temporal Difference methods with function approximation and Reinforce algorithm.
  * Implemented Q-learning, SARSA with Tile Coding and Radial basis function approximation methods, and Reinforce with and without baseline for Cart Pole and Mountain Car environment.

* [Mini Project](https://github.com/JS2498/RL_Lab/tree/main/Mini_project) : Policy Gradient Algorithms for Atari games
  * Trained Ray rllib A2C, A3C and PPO agents for Pong, Breakout and Space Invaders atari environments and compared their results along with expalination of each algorithm in the report.
